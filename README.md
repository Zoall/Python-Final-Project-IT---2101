# Python-Final-Project-IT---2101
* A final project for the course CS - 121 Advance Computer Programming.

# All in One Application
* A python application that contains 3 features.
* A very useful and handy app for students that is created using Python as the programming language and Tkinter as its module for the GUI.

# Features:
* Feature 1: A simple Calculator application that can perform basic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Square Roots.
* Feature 2: A python GUI application which converts different quantities such as Length, Weight, and Temperature.
* Feature 3: An elegant note pad or note editor application which can be used to take notes. Txt files are also saved and opened with the application mentioned.

* Module Used - Tkinter()-It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.

# Self-Assessment
| Metric        | Score           | Description |
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :----:|
| Code Reusablity | 3 | Implemented the DRY method in an acceptable manner. |
| Maintainablity  | 4 | The program is implemented based on OOP Principles. Debugging is less challenging than usual programs. |
| Scalability | 4 | Adding a new feature in the app or program is easier. |
| Execution | 4 | Handling of errors are remarkly done by using try catch exception. |
| Originality | 3 | Concept is quite similar to some samples since the topic or features used is common. |
| Overall Impression | 4 | The program or app runs smoothly without noticeable bugs or errors. |
